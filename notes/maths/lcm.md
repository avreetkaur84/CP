# üìò Least Common Multiple (LCM) - Competitive Programming Notes

## üß† What is LCM?

- **LCM (Least Common Multiple)** of two integers `a` and `b` is the smallest positive number divisible by both `a` and `b`.

$$
\text{LCM}(a, b) = \frac{a \cdot b}{\text{GCD}(a, b)}
$$

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Key Properties

### ‚úÖ Commutative
$$
\text{LCM}(a, b) = \text{LCM}(b, a)
$$

### ‚úÖ Associative
$$
\text{LCM}(a, b, c) = \text{LCM}(\text{LCM}(a, b), c)
$$

> üí° Useful when reducing an array:  
```cpp
int lcm = arr[0];
for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
    lcm = (lcm * arr[i]) / gcd(lcm, arr[i]);
}
````

### ‚úÖ LCM-GCD Identity

$$
\text{LCM}(a, b) \cdot \text{GCD}(a, b) = a \cdot b
$$

* Very useful in problems where you're given LCM and GCD and asked to reconstruct or analyze the numbers.

---

## ‚ö° Overflow Handling

> ‚ùó `a * b` can exceed `long long` range!

**Correct usage (safe):**

```cpp
long long lcm = (a / gcd(a, b)) * b;
```

Avoid:

```cpp
long long lcm = (a * b) / gcd(a, b);  // ‚ùå might overflow
```

Use `__int128` or BigInteger for large inputs.

## üß© Special Cases

| Case                   | Result                          |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| LCM(a, 0) or LCM(0, a) | `0`                             |
| LCM(0, 0)              | `undefined` (handle separately) |
| LCM of 1 and anything  | That number                     |

## üìö Applications in Competitive Programming

| Problem Type                | Use of LCM                         |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Scheduling tasks            | Find when multiple cycles sync     |
| CRT with non-coprime moduli | Combine using LCM                  |
| Array processing            | LCM of subarrays or entire array   |
| Constructive problems       | Build arrays with given LCM        |
| Cyclic patterns             | Minimum steps till pattern repeats |

## üõ†Ô∏è LCM in Arrays

### Compute LCM of entire array:

```cpp
long long arrayLCM(vector<int>& arr) {
    long long res = arr[0];
    for(int i = 1; i < arr.size(); i++) {
        res = (res / gcd(res, arr[i])) * arr[i];
        if (res > 1e18) break; // Overflow guard
    }
    return res;
}
```

---

## üö´ Modular Arithmetic Warning

LCM does **not** behave cleanly under mod:

* No identity like: `LCM(a, b) % m = ???`
* Avoid direct modular operations on LCM unless constraints are tight and under control

---

## üî¢ LCM of Primes

If all numbers are **distinct primes**:

$$
\text{LCM}(p_1, p_2, ..., p_k) = p_1 \cdot p_2 \cdot \dots \cdot p_k
$$

Used in prime generation, multiplicative number theory, etc.

---

## üß† Pattern Recognition

### Useful Relationship:

$$
\text{LCM}(a, b) = \frac{a \cdot b}{\text{GCD}(a, b)} \Rightarrow \text{GCD} = \frac{a \cdot b}{\text{LCM}}
$$

Often used to reverse-engineer values when only GCD or LCM is given.

---

## üß™ Typical CP Problems

### ‚úÖ Problem Patterns:

* Smallest number divisible by all array elements
* "Do x and y align every N seconds?" ‚Üí LCM(x, y)
* Construct array of N elements with LCM = K
* LCM ‚â§ K in subarrays
* LCM and GCD sum/max

## üìå Key Reminders

* Always use GCD to calculate LCM.
* Handle overflows with rearranged formula.
* LCM of multiple numbers ‚Üí reduce with associativity.
* `LCM` is a frequent trap for overflows ‚Äî test edge cases.

---

## üì¶ Bonus Tip: Write a Utility Function

```cpp
long long gcd(long long a, long long b) {
    return b == 0 ? a : gcd(b, a % b);
}

long long lcm(long long a, long long b) {
    return (a / gcd(a, b)) * b; // safe from overflow
}
```

---

## ‚ú® To-Do for Mastery

* [ ] Implement LCM function with safe overflow handling
* [ ] Practice at least 5 array-based LCM problems
* [ ] Revise LCM + GCD identity weekly
* [ ] Solve a CRT + LCM problem
* [ ] Understand `__int128` if dealing with huge numbers

## üß† Final Thought

> *LCM is like that polite kid in class ‚Äî quiet until you mess up your math or let it overflow. Treat it right, and it‚Äôll solve your hardest CP scheduling and math puzzles.*
