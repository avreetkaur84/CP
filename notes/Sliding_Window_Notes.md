# üß† Sliding Window ‚Äî Core Notes

### üß† General Conditions
1. **Contiguous Elements**:
   - Sliding window is used when the problem is asking for operations on **subarrays (contiguous sequences)**.

2. **Monotonicity (Optional)**:
   - Sometimes, you maintain a **monotonic deque** (increasing or decreasing) to keep track of maximum/minimum efficiently (used in problems like "Maximum in all subarrays of size K").

3. **Fixed or Variable Window**:
   - **Fixed-size window**: You slide by one and maintain the window size.
   - **Variable-size window**: You shrink and expand the window dynamically to satisfy some condition.

4. **Two Pointers**:
   - Most sliding window problems are an implementation of the **two pointers** pattern: `left` and `right` moving through the array.

5. **Prefix Sum is NOT Needed**:
   - Unlike brute force or range sum problems where prefix sum might be needed, sliding window often maintains a **rolling sum or count** as the window moves.

## Monotonic Behavior
Sliding Window works well when the value you're tracking changes monotonically:

| Problem Type                  | Monotonic Behavior | Sliding Window Friendly |
|------------------------------|--------------------|------------------------|
| Sum of only positive numbers  | Yes                | Yes                    |
| Count of distinct characters  | Yes                | Yes                    |
| Sum including negative numbers| No                 | Prefer Prefix Sum      |
| Product of elements           | No                 | Often unstable         |

If behavior is non-monotonic, consider using prefix sum, hash map, or binary search instead.

## When Not to Use Sliding Window?
Avoid sliding window when:
- You're dealing with non-contiguous elements.
- The value being tracked does not change predictably (non-monotonic).
- The problem involves combinatorics, recursion, or backtracking.
- You're working on multiple windows or need global scanning (e.g., LIS problems).

### üßæ Common Conditions / Checks for Applicability

| Condition | Explanation |
|----------|-------------|
| Problem involves subarrays / substrings | This is the most basic sign. |
| Asking for "longest/shortest" window with a property | Usually means **variable-sized window**. |
| Asking for "maximum/minimum" in every window of size K | Use **monotonic deque** with fixed window. |
| You need to maintain frequency/count in a range | Often used in **variable window + hashmap**. |
| Array is unbounded, but condition must be valid in window | Slide window until condition breaks, then shrink. |
| Input is a stream or too large for nested loops | Sliding window gives an O(n) or O(n log k) alternative. |

### üõ†Ô∏è Data Structures Often Used With Sliding Window

- **HashMap / HashSet**: To maintain frequencies (ex: longest substring without repeating characters).
- **Deque**: To maintain the min/max in a window in O(1) time (ex: max in sliding window).
- **Array**: If the frequency range is small (like 26 lowercase letters), use simple frequency arrays.


### üß™ Example-Based Conditions

| Problem Type | Technique |
|--------------|-----------|
| Longest substring with at most K distinct chars | Variable window, hashmap for char count |
| Subarray with sum <= K | Variable window, rolling sum |
| Max of each subarray of size K | Fixed window, monotonic deque |
| Count of substrings with all vowels | Variable window, hashset |
| Longest subarray with equal 0s and 1s | Convert 0s to -1s, use prefix sum + hashmap (not typical SW, but a trick variant) |

## üîÅ Common Approach (Fixed or Variable Size)
Sliding Window is used to reduce time complexity from **O(n¬≤)** to **O(n)** in problems that involve subarrays, substrings, or continuous segments.

---

## ‚úÖ 1. Fixed Size Sliding Window
Use this when window size is **given or fixed** (e.g., "Find max sum of subarray of size `k`").

**Pattern:**
```python
left = 0
current_sum = 0

for right in range(len(arr)):
    current_sum += arr[right]

    # shrink window when size exceeds k
    if right - left + 1 > k:
        current_sum -= arr[left]
        left += 1

    # process result when window is exactly size k
    if right - left + 1 == k:
        result = max(result, current_sum)  # or some condition
```

---

## ‚úÖ 2. Variable Size Sliding Window
Use this when window size **depends on a condition** (e.g., "Find the length of longest substring with at most `k` distinct characters").

**Pattern:**
```python
left = 0
for right in range(len(arr)):
    # Expand window: add arr[right]

    # While condition is invalid
    while <invalid_condition>:
        # Shrink window from left

    # Process result: window is valid
```

---

## ‚úÖ 3. "Exactly K" Trick Using At Most K - under variable size Sliding window

### üîç Problem Pattern

When you're asked to:
- **Count subarrays/substrings with exactly K distinct elements**
- Or any variation of ‚Äú**exactly K occurrences**‚Äù type constraints

### üö© Red Flag
If implementing "exactly K" directly feels:
- Overcomplicated
- Requires too many conditions
- Involves messy index tracking or nested logic

‚û°Ô∏è Then it's time to **pivot your approach**.

---

### ‚úÖ The Core Idea

Use this identity:

Count of subarrays with exactly K distinct elements =
    Count of subarrays with **at most K** distinct elements
  ‚Äì Count of subarrays with **at most (K - 1)** distinct elements

---

### üß† Why It Works?

- Every subarray with exactly K elements is **included in "at most K"**
- Every subarray with fewer than K elements is **included in "at most (K-1)"**
- Subtracting them leaves you with **only the ones that have exactly K**

---

### üß© Implementation Sketch

```cpp
int atMostK(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
    int i = 0, res = 0;
    unordered_map<int, int> freq;

    for (int j = 0; j < nums.size(); j++) {
        freq[nums[j]]++;

        while (freq.size() > k) {
            freq[nums[i]]--;
            if (freq[nums[i]] == 0) freq.erase(nums[i]);
            i++;
        }

        res += (j - i + 1); // all valid subarrays ending at j
    }

    return res;
}

int subarraysWithKDistinct(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
    return atMostK(nums, k) - atMostK(nums, k - 1);
}
```

---

### üß† When to Use This Pattern?

- You're counting subarrays or substrings with **exact** number of distinct items
- Direct logic is getting too messy
- You already know how to do "at most K" using sliding window

---

### üèÅ Summary

| You Are Asked For...       | Consider Using...               |
|----------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Exactly K distinct items   | `atMost(K) - atMost(K - 1)`     |
| Exactly K satisfying conds | Difference of prefix counts     |

This is a **powerful technique** for converting hard counting problems into easier ones using sliding window + basic math.

# üì¶ Where is Sliding Window Applicable?

## üîπ Strings / Substrings
- Longest substring with **no repeating** characters
- Longest substring with **at most k** distinct characters
- Minimum window substring containing all characters of another string
- Check if one string is a permutation of another (`s1` in `s2`)

## üîπ Arrays / Subarrays
- Max sum/min sum of subarray of size `k`
- Smallest subarray with sum ‚â• `target`
- Count of subarrays with exactly `k` distinct elements
- Max element in every window of size `k` (requires deque)

## üîπ Binary Arrays
- Longest subarray of 1‚Äôs after flipping at most `k` zeroes
- Longest subarray with equal number of 0‚Äôs and 1‚Äôs (convert to +1/-1 and use hashmap)

## üîπ Count Based or Frequency-Based
- Count number of substrings that match a pattern
- Count distinct elements in each window

## üîπ Two Pointer Variant (special case of sliding window)
- Trapping rain water (advanced)
- Subarrays with product less than `k`
- Longest mountain or peak in array

---

# ‚ö†Ô∏è Edge Patterns
- Use **hashmap or frequency map** if condition is based on characters/elements.
- In some problems, window shrinkage might not be based on size but on **frequency/constraint violation**.
