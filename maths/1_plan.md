## 📓 Toolset & Notebook Strategy

### Mistake Log

Track every failure:

* Problem link
* Where you got stuck
* What was the trick/insight?
* What pattern does it relate to?

### Pattern Playbook

Maintain sections like:

* AP / GP series
* nCr / Permutations
* Modulo math
* Geometry tricks
* Number property observations

Use for daily review. Update after every contest.

## 🧘 Mindset for Growth

> "If the problem isn’t solving with DSA, it’s a math trick in disguise."

### Key Principles:

* Never skip postmortem — most learning happens *after* failing
* Write before you code when stuck
* Always brute-force small inputs to see patterns
