# Math + DSA Pattern Mastery Plan

## Phase 1: Pattern Recognition & Formula Intuition (Daily Practice Plan)

### Core Goals:

* Build mathematical pattern recognition for DSA-heavy topics (e.g., number theory, combinatorics).
* Train your brain to convert observations → formulas → code.
* Learn how to approach problems where brute force is not feasible.

---

## ✅ CURRENT FOCUS: Combinatorics & Counting (Target: 1 Week)

### 📚 Core Concepts to Master:

1. **nCr, nPr using Factorials**

   * Precompute factorials & inverse factorials using modular arithmetic.
   * Understand difference between permutations and combinations.
   * Learn mod inverse via Fermat’s Little Theorem (if prime mod).

2. **Inclusion-Exclusion Principle (IEP)**

   * Count total, subtract overlaps.
   * Example: count of numbers divisible by 2 or 3 or 5.

3. **Stars and Bars Theorem**

   * Count the number of ways to distribute `r` identical items among `n` distinct bins.
   * Formula: `C(r + n - 1, n - 1)`

4. **Pigeonhole Principle**

   * If `n+1` items go into `n` boxes, at least one box contains two items.
   * Often appears in proof-based or logic-heavy DSA.

5. **Permutations with/without Repetition**

   * Multisets: dividing by factorials of duplicate counts.
   * Anagrams, passwords, arrangements.
